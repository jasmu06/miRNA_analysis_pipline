RuleException in rule count_features in file /Users/jasmu/tumor_mirna/Snakefile, line 57:
NameError: The name "'annotation'" is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:
featureCounts -T {threads} -a {config['annotation']} -o {output} {params.extra} {input.bam}
